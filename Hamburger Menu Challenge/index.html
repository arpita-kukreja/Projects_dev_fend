        Chef's developer journey begins here — in a digital universe where creativity meets code.  
        Inspired by Spider-Man's precision and balance, Chef steps into the <b>Spider-Verse</b> to explore  
        the art of crafting seamless, responsive, and immersive web experiences.

    <h2>About the Spider-Verse Mission</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>Spider-Verse Developer Mission</b> is a creative front-end learning journey  
      that blends storytelling with hands-on development. Each chapter focuses on a specific concept —  
      structure, responsiveness, interactivity, or animation — helping developers grow through practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This first mission sets the tone. It emphasizes layout design, balance, and attention to user experience —  
      key principles that every great interface, and every great Spider-Man, relies on.

    <h2>Story So Far</h2>
    <p>
      After years of building small projects and learning the ropes of web development,  
      Chef found himself searching for a bigger challenge. One late night, while refining his code,  
      an unexpected signal from the multiverse appeared on his terminal — a transmission from the <b>Spider-Verse Network</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The message was clear: *“Every web has a pattern. Every developer has a mission.”*  
      With that, Chef accepted the call — stepping into a multidimensional world of design, logic, and creativity.  
      Guided by the mysterious “Web-Slinger 42,” his training begins here.

    <h2>Begin Your Journey</h2>
    <p>
      The web is your canvas — each tag, each style, and each interaction forms a part of your story.  
      Just as Spider-Man connects worlds with his web, developers connect users through their creations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Step forward, Developer. The <b>Spider-Verse</b> has opened its gates — and this is where your mission begins.
